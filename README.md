# Todo App Flutter

<p>
This is a project that was developed using Dart and Flutter. 
<br>
This is my second application developed by watching courses, it is a basic application where you can add tasks to be done and remove them once completed
<br>
<br>
Feel free to send questions, criticisms and suggestions, if you have any ideas to improve the code you are welcome!
</p>

## Prerequisites
<p>
Make sure you have Flutter, Dart, NODE, NPM and Git installed on your system.
</p>

## How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/repository-name.git
```

<p>
Navigate to the repository directory:
</p>

```
cd repository-name
```

<p>
Install all the dependencies with:
</p>

```
flutter pub get
```

<p>
Choose the device on which the application will run (I recommend mobile)
</p>

Here we have the application's home screen, where we have the option to add the task to be done

After writing the task in the field and clicking on the "+" the task is added to the queue

Where we have the option to complete the task by dragging to the direct side

And to delete it, you would just drag it to the left and click on the trash can

And if you want to remove them all at the same time, you can click on "clear tasks" and a confirmation modal appears to remove them.
