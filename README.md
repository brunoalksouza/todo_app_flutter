# Todo App Flutter

<p>
This is a project that was developed using Dart and Flutter. 
<br>
This is my second application developed by watching courses, it is a basic application where you can add tasks to be done and remove them once completed

Feel free to send questions, criticisms and suggestions, if you have any ideas to improve the code you are welcome!
